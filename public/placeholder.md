# Placeholder Images

This directory is for placeholder images used in development.

The application uses placeholder URLs like `/api/placeholder/400/300` which can be replaced with:
- Cloudinary URLs for production
- Local images from `/images` folder
- External CDN images

For development, you can use services like:
- https://via.placeholder.com/
- https://placehold.co/
- https://picsum.photos/

Or add real images to this directory and reference them.
